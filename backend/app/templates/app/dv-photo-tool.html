    <h3>Why Use a DV Photo Checker?</h3>
    <p>
        The DV program has specific photo requirements. A photo that doesn’t meet these standards may disqualify your application. Our DV Photo Checker reviews essential details like size, background, and lighting, helping you avoid common mistakes.
    </p>

    <h3>What the DV Photo Tool Checks</h3>
    <p>Our DV Photo Tool evaluates your photo based on these requirements:</p>

        <li><strong>File Size:</strong> The photo size must be equal to or less than 240 kB.</li>
        <li><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> The photo must be in a square aspect ratio, meaning the height and width must be equal.</li>
        <li><strong>Recency:</strong> Taken within the last six months.</li>
        <li><strong>Background:</strong> Plain white or off-white background.</li>
        <li><strong>Head Position:</strong> Centered, taking up about 50-70% of the photo.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye Position:</strong> Eyes should be 1 to 1 3/8 inches from the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Even lighting, no shadows.</li>
        <li><strong>No Accessories:</strong> No glasses or items covering the face.</li>
